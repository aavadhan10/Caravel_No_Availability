Tripp counted many of his friends as clients and many of his clients as friends, a testament to his exceptional qualities as both a skilled lawyer and a caring human being. Our hearts are with Tripp’s family and the many friends he left behind. May his memory be a blessing.</strong></p>

<div class=""section experience"">

Herbert Burgunder's primary areas of practice are real estate (including commercial, residential, and real estate litigation), land use and zoning (variances, conditional uses, grandfathered uses, non-conforming uses, special exceptions, zoning appeals, and change in use), business law, contracts, and landlord/tenant issues.  Throughout his years of practice, Mr. Burgunder has developed a keen eye for direct communication and smooth transactions. His clients can count on him to keep their best interests in mind. Simple documents and straightforward language are his hallmarks. A real estate purchase might be accomplished with a two-page contract. A zoning memorandum of law will speak directly to the issues before the board or zoning commissioner.

Lisa Weinstein Burns is a partner in Rimon’s Private Client Group. For over 20 years, Ms. Burns has concentrated her practice in the areas of tax planning, multi-generational wealth transfers, business succession planning, estate planning and estate administration.

Ms. Burns approaches estate planning as a holistic process.  Estate planning is one of the most important investments a person can make. Ms. Burns seeks to protect a family’s well-being by preserving the wealth that has taken a lifetime or more to acquire through creation of a plan to promote family harmony and minimize taxes to the extent feasible. She listens to clients’ needs and coordinates with their advisors to customize documents and overall planning strategies to meet those needs.

Her work with clients includes drafting a variety of estate planning documents including wills, revocable trusts, irrevocable insurance and generation-skipping trusts, qualified personal residence trusts, charitable trusts, durable powers of attorney and healthcare proxies. Ms. Burns also assists executors and fiduciaries with estate and trust administration matters.

Ms. Burns has achieved an AV Preeminent Rating in Martindale Hubbell from her peers, which is the highest possible rating for both ethical standards and legal ability. Ms. Burns has been elected as a Fellow to the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel (ACTEC), which recognizes attorneys who have established outstanding reputations among their peers in terms of skill, experience, and high standards of professional and ethical conduct in the practice of trusts and estates law. Ms. Burns has been recognized by Boston Magazine and Law Politics magazine as a “Super Lawyer Rising Star” in the area of Trusts and Estates.

In the April 2008 issue of Women's Business Boston, Ms. Burns was named one of The Top 10 Lawyers by readers. Ms. Burns is a lecturer for Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) and has published several articles on various legal topics. Ms. Burns has served as a member of the Nominating Committee for Shir Tikvah synagogue in Winchester, Massachusetts, and as a member of the Winchester Hospital Foundation Advisory Council.

A few examples of Ms. Burns’ work are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Designed a transfer strategy utilizing Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs) to move appreciation from targeted assets from parent to trust for children while minimizing transfer taxes and enabling parent to retain an interest in the principal asset.</li>
 	<li>Executed sale of multi-million dollar family-owned business to future generations via grantor dynasty trust without incurring capital gains tax and minimizing gift and estate taxes for the grantor.  The dynasty trust, which is fully generation-skipping tax exempt, will protect and preserve the family business stock from estate tax and creditor claims in future generations, as well as help maintain consistent and orderly management of the company.</li>
 	<li>Developed strategy to pass $5 Million family vacation home to the next generation in trust over a term of years by establishing multiple long-term Qualified Personal Residence Trusts (QPRTs) to minimize use of federal gift tax exemption.</li>

Dr. Chen’s practice focuses on patent prosecution and counseling and he also is experienced in the areas of patent litigation, inter parties review, reexamination, interference, opposition, and licensing. Dr. Chen has been ranked in the fields of biotechnology law, patent law and patent litigation 2009-2023 by Best Lawyer in America.  In 2018, Dr. Chen was selected as ""Lawyer of the Year"" in Patent Law in San Diego by <em>Best Lawyer</em>.  Dr. Chen also was ranked as a regional expert on China intellectual property 2011-2015 by Chambers Global.

Prior to joining Rimon PC, Dr. Chen worked at Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP since 2000, including being a partner at Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP since 2005.

For numerous clients, Dr. Chen manages entire patent portfolios, advising the clients on maximizing their patent positions and designing patent strategies. On behalf of one client, he obtained U.S. patent protection for its novel diagnostic test and advised the client in designing around a third party’s patents. When the third party threatened to sue the client, he worked with several Morrison &amp; Foerster patent litigators in obtaining summary judgments of non-infringement twice from the District Court, and eventually won the appeal from the Federal Circuit. (General Atomics Diazyme Labs. Div. v. Axis-Shield ASA, 277 Fed. Appx. 1001, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 10235 (Fed. Cir. 2008)).

In another case, Dr. Chen worked with a team of litigation attorneys, successfully reversing a summary judgment of infringement and eventually obtaining a jury verdict of non-infringement for the client in the District Court. After the case was remanded to the District Court, he filed reexamination request of the claims asserted by the patentee to the USPTO. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board) in the USPTO invalidated the claims and the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board’s decision. (In re Swanson, 540 F.3d 1368; 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18928 (Fed. Cir. 2008)).

While earning his B.S., Dr. Chen was on the Dean’s List. After receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Chen conducted his post-doctoral fellowship at Yale University School of Medicine. He was also a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar while in law school.
<h2><strong>SELECTED EXPERIENCE</strong></h2>
<strong><em>Abbott Laboratories v. Syntron Bioresearch.</em></strong>

Successfully reversed a summary judgment of infringement of a biotechnology patent for a client and eventually obtained a jury verdict of non-infringement for Syntron Bioresearch in a patent suit brought by Abbott Laboratories alleging that Syntron’s test kits infringed two of Abbott’s lateral flow immunoassay patents. Before Morrison &amp; Foerster was retained, the Court had granted summary judgment of infringement in favor of Abbott. We successfully persuaded the Court to reconsider its ruling and to allow Syntron to proceed to trial. After a three-week trial, the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement on both patents asserted by Abbott. On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed all issues, except the construction of a single claim term. Following appeal, the case was settled on the terms Syntron had originally proposed.
<div></div>
<div><em><strong>Abbott's glucose sensor patents</strong>.</em></div>
<div></div>
Abbott sued DexCom using seven patents in anticipation of FDA approval of DexCom’s short term embedded glucose sensor. Abbott threatened to seek preliminary injunction when DexCom was getting ready to launch its products. We used reexamination as part of the strategy to defeat the anticipated preliminary injunction motion from Abbott. We requested reexamination of all seven Abbott patents. The U.S. PTO granted reexamination of all seven Abbott patents. The Court stayed the litigation pending the resolution of the reexamination. As for Abbott, it backed down on seeking a preliminary injunction when DexCom launched its glucose sensor in 2006.
<div></div>
<div><strong><em>Zyon’s urine cup collection patents</em>.</strong></div>
<div></div>
Zyon sued Acon for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,805,837 (‘837 patent) and 6,805,838 (‘838 patent). We requested reexamination of the ‘837 and ‘838 patents on a double patenting issue. The U.S. PTO invalidated Zyon’s patents based on the double patenting issue.

<span class=""notes"">J.D., cum laude, Dean's List</span>
<p class=""university"">Roma Tre University</p>
<span class=""notes"">J.D., summa cum laude</span>","Sonia Oliveri’s practice focuses on business immigration, EB-5, and on commercial clients’ immigration and international business needs. A native of Italy, Ms. Oliveri is fluent in six languages: English, Farsi, Italian, French, Portugese and Spanish.

Ms. Oliveri is a highly accomplished immigration attorney. She assists corporate clients, foreign corporations and investors with complex corporate transactions and immigration matters, with an emphasis on the EB-5 program, E-1/E-2 treaty trader and investor programs, H-1B visa matters, and L-1 intracompany transferee visa applications. Ms. Oliveri counsels foreign national clients on obtaining green cards through either individual direct, pooled investments, or regional center EB-5 investments, nationwide. She serves clients seeking solutions to complex immigration and business issues. She also works with employers and human resources departments on I-9 compliance as well as H-1B and LCA compliance. She regularly counsels businesses on immigration-related regulatory compliance issues including employment-eligibility verification issues, E-Verify and I-9 audits, internal audits and reviews.

Ms. Oliveri represents clients with domestic and international interests concerning international/cross-border transactions and international estate matters. Clientele from all over the world -- specifically Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and India -- rely on her cultural experience and global international background and perspective for matters that require cultural sensitivity. She leverages her international business abilities and interpersonal skills in complex international matters, corporate and immigration-related. Ms. Oliveri presents creative solutions and identifies issues before they become problematic, while delivering the highest levels of customer attention and care.

The combination of her international business and multilingual background allows Ms. Oliveri to bring unique expertise to the EB-5 arena. Her thorough understanding of the broad issues associated with business migration to the U.S. permits her to recognize and communicate to clients many of the complex issues of the U.S. business immigration processes outside of the traditional application filings with USCIS.

Ms. Oliveri has also served clients worldwide including treaty investors (E-2), and traders (E-1), immigrant investors, regional centers, multi-national managers and corporations, small businesses, artists, entertainers, athletes, students, trainees, professionals, managers, executives, employers, and individuals seeking solutions to complex immigration and business issues.

Ms. Oliveri has developed strong professional relationships in her field. She provides advice on the complexities of immigration matters to the clients of numerous U.S. investment groups, regional centers, and developers. Additionally, Ms. Oliveri advises these groups on EB-5 program compliance, including developing new projects that qualify for EB-5 investments, preparing amendment filings, and applying for exemplar petitions. Ms. Oliveri works with securities lawyers, economists, business plan writers and other professionals on the preparation and filing of regional center designations and regional center amendment applications. From the beginning of her career, Ms. Oliveri has been responsible for filing hundreds of EB-5 petitions. She also advises individuals, businesses and regional centers on EB-5 compliance issues and complex U.S. immigration and nationality matters.

Prior to joining the firm, Ms. Oliveri was a partner with Kelley Kronenberg, where she created and led the firm’s EB-5 and Immigration practice groups. Prior to that, Ms. Oliveri was an attorney for a major immigration investment law firm. There, she gained experience in business immigration, advising high-net-worth foreign nationals and companies on business agreements, business and investor visas, commercial lease agreements, contract negotiations, corporate formation, employment, employment-based applications and global immigration.",Immigration Law,"<ul>

Mr. Ross works with clients to prepare customized estate plans involving generation-skipping trusts, charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, family limited partnerships, family limited liability companies, grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs), irrevocable insurance trusts, and private family foundations. He has extensive experience in legal issues involving federal estate, gift and generation-skipping taxation. A few examples of Mr. Ross’s work are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>
<div>Created irrevocable trusts for the 3 children of a company founder that each qualified for an additional $10 million Qualified Small Business Stock (“QSBS”) exclusion, and that defer California state income tax.  So altogether, the family had $40 million of QSBS exclusion.  When the company liquidity event occurred, the family paid no federal capital gains tax on $40 million of gain, and the children’s irrevocable trusts paid no California state income tax.  If trust distributions are made to the children at a later time when they are California residents, then the California state income tax will be paid at that time on the amount distributed.  Until the time of the distribution, the entire trust will grow free of California state income tax, much like an IRA for California tax purposes.  And the amount not distributed will continue to grow free of California state income tax.   If distributions are made to the children at a later time when they are not California residents, then no California state income will be paid on these distributions.</div></li>
 	<li>
<div>Developed a strategy to transfer $75 million of family legacy real estate to a dynasty trust without incurring gift tax, and fully covered by generation-skipping tax exemption. The dynasty trust will protect that real estate from estate tax, creditor claims and divorce claims in perpetuity.</div></li>
 	<li>
<div>Worked with venture capital partners to transfer carried interests to irrevocable children's trusts at the beginning of the fund when those interests were of modest value, and watched those interests grow in value to more than $10 million, thereby transferring significant wealth while using minimal gift tax exemption.</div></li>
 	<li>
<div>Developed multiple term of years flip charitable remainder trust strategy to hold extensive position in large public company that was a possible hostile acquisition target, so that client could (a) benefit the client's private foundation when he chose by terminating one or more of the trusts early in whole or in part; (b) get the stock into a structure which would avoid capital gains tax on a sudden forced sale in a hostile acquisition; and (c) still give the client the right to cash flow from one or more of the trusts if he decided he needed it, by triggering the flip mechanism.</div></li>
</ul>
Mr. Ross uses a values-based planning approach, working with clients to structure plans that focus on inherited wealth having a positive effect on their heirs, and on leaving a legacy in the broadest sense of the word. Scott also assists surviving spouses, children, successor trustees, and executors in the administration of trusts and estates following a death. Mr. Ross has been recognized for his accomplishments by Best Lawyers in America in trusts and estates from 2006 to 2022.

He also counsels clients on a range of other transactional matters, including trade and receivable finance (including default-triggered puts and vendor/account receivable and trade financing); bankruptcy transactional matters including distressed investing, rescue and debtor-in-possession finance, sales under Bankruptcy Code Section 363, and true sale and substantive consolidation; corporate trust and agency; structured products; private placements; portfolio management and monitoring; and securities law matters.

Mr. Schneller’s clients include global and domestic banks, financial institutions, investment funds, companies and other parties including secured and unsecured creditors; agents to and lenders in syndicated and club lending groups; investors; trustees and collateral agents; and unsecured creditors. He represents clients in various finance and insolvency transactional matters, out-of-court restructurings (including cross-border and international), and the analysis and exercise of rights and remedies, including in proceedings pending under bankruptcy and insolvency laws in the US and other jurisdictions around the globe.

A portion of Mr. Schneller’s practice emphasizes investments and trading in syndicated and bilateral loans, loan portfolios, securities, claims, derivatives and other interests in domestic and international obligors and debtors in, near or emerging from financial distress, using LSTA, LMA and bespoke documentation. He advises clients regarding bankruptcy, reorganization, intercreditor and creditors’ rights matters. Mr. Schneller has also spoken and written about many of these areas, including intercreditor arrangements, the secondary market for and trading of bank loans and trade claims (including on LSTA, LMA and bespoke documents), and confidentiality and “big boy” matters.

During the past several years, Mr. Schneller has advised numerous clients in connection with thousands of transactions in bank loans, trade claims, swap claims, notes and other securities, and other financial instruments relating to distressed and performing borrowers, issuers and obligors, including debtors in the most noteworthy bankruptcy cases and insolvencies in the United States and around the globe.

In addition to his active legal practice, at prior firms Mr. Schneller has been, among other things, (i) the sole representative responsible for establishing and running the London office, (ii) the New York local practice section leader for the global finance practice, and (iii) the leader of the distressed investing and secondary trading practices.

Mr. Schneller maintains an active pro bono legal practice. He has worked with the Clemency Project, which assisted federal prisoners, sentenced a decade or more ago to lengthy imprisonment for non-violent drug offenses, to seek the shorter sentences that likely would be imposed under current sentencing guidelines. Mr. Schneller has also represented a national not-for-profit organization committed to anti-bullying and anti-cyberbullying efforts; an animal rescue charity; various not-for-profit organizations in connection with corporate governance and tax-exempt issues; and low-income individuals seeking debt relief and protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.

Michael Smith is an associate in the Intellectual Property (IP) group at Rimon Law. Before he became a patent attorney, Dr. Smith was a research scientist for many years, and he draws on his deep understanding of life sciences and corporate R&amp;D, as well as his extensive legal experience, while assisting each client to develop and implement an IP strategy optimized to meet their unique business needs. He has a track record of helping companies establish strong IP practices and cultures, providing IP guidance to early-stage research projects, capturing inventions at all stages of R&amp;D, drafting and prosecuting patent applications, counseling management on IP-related opportunities and risks, and reviewing and drafting contracts to support both research and licensing.

Dr. Smith received his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry from Cal Tech, then spent 15 years at Dow AgroSciences, where he led the herbicide Project Creation chemistry program and developed a deep understanding of chemical technology, corporate R&amp;D processes, and the importance of taking steps to protect IP from the earliest stages of research.  He also passed the USPTO patent bar before starting law school.

At Berkeley School of Law, Dr. Smith focused on intellectual property law, joining the Berkeley Technology Journal and earning the Boalt Law &amp; Technology Certificate.  He began his legal career at Morrison &amp; Foerster’s San Diego office, where he spent seven years working on a diverse range of technologies and legal issues, including patent application drafting and prosecution, patent litigation support, opinion work to guide critical business decisions, IP diligence for licensing transactions, and both offensive and defensive reexaminations of US patents.

Dr. Smith then went in-house to work for NIBR (the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research—the discovery research division of Novartis Pharmaceuticals) in Emeryville CA, where he focused on IP for small-molecule oncology and infectious disease programs.  In addition to obtaining patent protection for development compounds and related inventions, he provided guidance to help early-stage projects avoid IP issues, trained scientists on IP topics, contributed extensively to the Patent department’s practices and guidelines, advised business leaders on IP and related legal issues, provided IP diligence for technology licensing and collaboration projects, and drafted and reviewed contracts and agreements such as MTAs, CDAs, and research collaboration agreements.

Dr. Smith left Novartis after six and a half years to return ‘home’ to San Diego, where he joined Rimôn Law. He now uses his extensive experience to assist clients with a broad range of patent-related and chemistry-related IP needs.

<span class=""notes"">B.A.</span>","Neal Levin is an accomplished Fraud, Investigations and Asset Recovery attorney. Neal contends with a litany of fraudsters and fraudulent transactions, including those stemming from bankruptcy fraud, occupational fraud, corporate governance fraud, government corruption, insurance fraud, bank fraud, mortgage fraud, asset concealment, so-called asset protection plans, offshore financial centers, blockchain, bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, art fraud and related thefts, and, of course, Ponzi schemes. His practice is international in scope, encompassing expertise in Foreign Money Judgment Recognition and Enforcement, Arbitration Award Enforcement, Chapter 15 Bankruptcy, and International Discovery under 28 USC §1782. He has appeared in dozens of different tribunals over the course of over 30 years in the business.

Neal and his team, which includes an internal investigations unit, leverage their success through use of progressive intel harvesting as well as an intensive study of the psychology of fraudsters and victims. Drawing on both his many years of experience as well as his B.A. in Psychology from the University of Denver, Neal frequently lectures, writes, and is interviewed on the psychopathy and sociopathy of a fraudster and victims as well as on Ponzi schemes, bankruptcy fraud, investigations, and recovery practices.

Neal also serves as a Federal and State Equity Receiver in matters involving domestic and international fraud and financial crimes.

Neal received his B.A. in Psychology and Political Science from University of Denver and his J.D. from DePaul University College of Law.

He knows first-hand the valuable contribution that a small business can have to a community and its economy. James knows that with the right counsel, the law can be a tool to help businesses achieve their goals of survival, growth and ultimately prosper.  While most businesses only consult with attorneys in the wake of a pending lawsuit or emergent business issue, James works with his clients from the onset of the relationship taking time to meet and understand both the people and the business. His goal is to become a counselor and asset to his clients.

James serves as outside general counsel to businesses large and small across Missouri and Illinois. He works closely with company leadership to become a part of the team, coordinating all legal needs across corporate, transactional, litigation, real estate, and other disciplines. His clients include real estate developers; craft breweries; beer, wine and alcohol distributors and wholesalers; startup businesses; high net worth individuals and families; aerospace manufacturers; and retailers who transact business across the region.

James also represents individuals and businesses in civil litigation matters. Most frequently, these matters involve complex contractual disputes, struggles over corporate control, real estate, insurance coverage, intellectual property, as well as TRO and injunction issues. James has tried more than 30 matters to conclusion in state and federal, as well as numerous private arbitrations. He has extensive first-hand experience with the use of technology in all stages of the litigation cycle, particularly e-discovery, drawing upon an undergraduate and private workplace background in computer science.

James has also represented clients in a number of industries, including commercial/military aerospace, construction, medical billing, alcohol production and distribution, and consumer goods during investigations and/or administrative proceedings conducted by state and/or federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Internal Revenue Service. Specific to the alcoholic beverage industry, James provides general project evaluation services and business counsel for startup craft breweries, wineries, and distilleries. He handles the entire legal process of starting and growing a business in the beverage industry, handling federal, state, and local application and licensing, real property and site evaluation and negotiation, intellectual property protection, and strategic business guidance.

Finally, James provides counsel to businesses on what is often one of the biggest influencers on a balance sheet – real estate. He regularly handles real property assemblage and acquisition, public-private partnerships and development agreements, tax and governmental incentives for residential, commercial and mixed use development/redevelopment, special taxing district formation, finance arrangements including acquisition &amp; development, construction, and semi/permanent financing, entity formation and governance, project modeling and evaluation for general and limited partners, development and redevelopment, post-development and sale, sale-leaseback, and/or unwinding in tax incentive developments.

He also has extensive experience advising and representing nonprofit entities, including religious and community organizations, in corporate governance and employment matters.

Daniel has spent his career immersed in the art and science of trial advocacy, and now brings that experience to large- and medium-sized companies in their commercial and employment cases. His approach to legal services begins with listening to each client, thoroughly learning their business, internalizing their concerns and making their challenges his own. Daniel’s personal philosophy is to litigate every case as if it will go to trial, incur no legal expense before its time and always remember that success is resolving the dispute in the client’s favor in the most efficient way – not merely “scoring points” or litigating for its own sake.

Clients appreciate Daniel’s calm, nonanxious presence, sober and clear advice and professional but aggressive approach that keeps adversaries off-balance and out-gunned. He concentrates on contract, corporate governance, trade secret and unfair competition disputes, as well as on defending businesses against claims of discrimination, harassment, retaliation and wrongful termination.","Employment Law, Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation, Litigation and Alternative Dispute Resolution, Wage and Hour","<ul>

Joseph is an experienced trial and appellate lawyer who takes pride in his ability to persuasively advocate for his clients in the courtroom, as a skilled brief-writer, and while negotiating dispute resolution.

To that end, Joseph prioritizes efficiency and looks for opportunities to utilize alternative dispute resolution.
